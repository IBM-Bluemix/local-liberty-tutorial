1. In server.xml, a new webApplication is added. We need to reference the *cloudantNoSQLDB-library* in this webapp so that it can access the CouchDB libraries. Edit server.xml and change the definition of the webApplication from

  ```
  <webApplication id="local-liberty-tutorial" location="local-liberty-tutorial.war" name="local-liberty-tutorial"/>
  ```

  to:

  ```
  <webApplication id="local-liberty-tutorial" location="local-liberty-tutorial.war" name="local-liberty-tutorial">
    <classloader commonLibraryRef="cloudantNoSQLDB-library">
    </classloader>
  </webApplication>
  ```
