## Deploy the application to Bluemix

Our application is running locally.
Now we will deploy it to the cloud.

1. Build the application WAR file. Either from Eclipse or from the command line in the application directory:

  ```
  mvn package
  ```
  
  The command generates the WAR in *target/local-liberty-tutorial.war*.
  
1. Create a Cloudant service named *cloudant-for-liberty*

  ```
  $ cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Lite cloudant-for-liberty
  ```

  *Note: you can also create this service from the Bluemix web console*

1. The application comes with a Cloud Foundry [manifest.yml](manifest.yml) file that describes its dependencies
on the Cloudant and Personality Insights services. From the application directory, run:

  ```
  $ cf push
  ```

  The output will look like:
  
  ```

1. Notice in the output the statement about *Auto-configuration*, this is the Liberty for Java buildpack
automatically wiring out the Cloudant service to our app. This is equivalent to the steps we did manually in 
a [previous step](004-LIBERTY-COUCHDB.md) for our local Liberty profile and Apache CouchDB.

1. Navigate to the application url. It is shown in the last lines of the *cf push* output. Look for *urls:*.
It was randomly generated for our application as specified in the manifest.yml.

1. Click the "Use sample text" link. This fills the textarea and description with sample data.

1. Click "Submit". It should work just like in our local version.

This concludes the tutorial. You can develop locally and push to Bluemix when you're ready.
