## Configure Personality Insights

Our application is running but it is missing a core piece: the Personality Insights service.
For this one, there is no local equivalent. Ideally we would create a mock service so that 
we can work offline on other pieces of the application but here we are gonna look at how we 
can have our local application connect to a Personality Insights service running in IBM Bluemix.

So let's create a new Personality Insights service in Bluemix using the user interface or 
the command line and retrieve the credentials we will need to use to call the service.

### Provision a Personality Insights service from the Bluemix console

1. Connect to the Bluemix console

1. In the catalog, select Personality Insights

1. Set the service name to *pi-for-liberty* and click Create

  ![](images/create-pi.png)

1. Select the service in the Bluemix dashboard
   1. Go to *Service Credentials*
   1. Click *Add Credentials*
   1. Set the name to *For local dev*

  Keep the page open, we will need them soon.

### Or provision a Personality Insights service from the command-line

1. Create the Personality Insights service in Bluemix 

  ```
  $ cf create-service personality_insights tiered pi-for-liberty
  ```

1. Create a new set of credentials

  ```
  $ cf create-service-key pi-for-liberty "For local dev"
  Creating service key For local dev for service instance pi-for-liberty as user@domain...
  OK
  ```
  
1. Retrieve the credentials

  ```
  $ cf service-key pi-for-liberty "For local dev"
  Getting key For local dev for service instance pi-for-liberty as user@domain..
  
  {
    "password": "cr01Nv3fdf",
    "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/personality-insights/api",
    "username": "1e42D6-2533-4455-8536-20cbd4545456"
  }
  ```

### Set VCAP_SERVICES

When you deploy an application in Cloud Foundry, all information about the services bound 
to the application are made available through the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.
The variable contains a JSON document. Assuming you bind a Cloudant and a Personality Insights services 
to your application, the VCAP_SERVICES variable would look like:

  ```
  {
   "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "cloudantNoSQLDB": [
     {
      "credentials": {
       "host": "df15642d-3859-4edz-b546-1654516512f1-bluemix.cloudant.com",
       "password": "1564612465dsq65d454654651d6e54e5616de654dred6542134651654001e381",
       "port": 443,
       "url": "https://df15642d-3859-4edz-b546-1654516512f1-bluemix:1564612465dsq65d454654651d6e54e5616de654dred6542134651654001e381@df15642d-3859-4edz-b546-1654516512f1-bluemix.cloudant.com",
       "username": "df15642d-3859-4edz-b546-1654516512f1"
      },
      "label": "cloudantNoSQLDB",
      "name": "cloudant-for-liberty",
      "plan": "Lite",
      "tags": [
       "data_management",
       "ibm_created",
       "ibm_dedicated_public"
      ]
     }
    ],
    "personality_insights": [
     {
      "credentials": {
       "password": "f1f6sf71359p",
       "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/personality-insights/api",
       "username": "1165fred-f155-16168111dg5465132f1231"
      },
      "label": "personality_insights",
      "name": "pi-for-liberty",
      "plan": "tiered",
      "tags": [
       "watson",
       "ibm_created",
       "ibm_dedicated_public"
      ]
     }
    ]
   }
  }
  ```

Typically you would parse this variable (manually or through helper libraries) to retrieve 
the credentials of a service. In our application, the code uses the [Watson Developer Cloud Java SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk/)
to call the Personality Insights service. The SDK is able to automatically lookup the service credentials
by looking at the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.

When Liberty starts, it injects the variables defined in *server.env* into the environment.
Let's configure a VCAP_SERVICES environment variable in this file.

1. Open the *server.env* file (in *your-liberty-home-dir/usr/servers/defaultServer/server.env*)

  ![](images/server-env.png)
  
  Note: if this file does not exist, create it. You can also use Eclipse for this: right click on the
  Liberty server profile then select New / Server Environment File / server.env

1. The relevant part that we need from the VCAP_SERVICES above is the value of the "VCAP_SERVICES" node
and in our case, we will keep only the personality_insights information:

  ```
  {
    "personality_insights": [
      {
        "credentials": {
          "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
          "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/personality-insights/api",
          "username": "YOUR_USERNAME"
        },
        "label": "personality_insights",
        "name": "pi-for-liberty",
        "plan": "tiered",
        "tags": [
          "watson",
          "ibm_created",
          "ibm_dedicated_public"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  However *server.env* requires the value to fit on one line so instead we will use:  

  ```
  VCAP_SERVICES={"personality_insights":[{"credentials":{"password":"YOUR_PASSWORD","url":"https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/personality-insights/api","username":"YOUR_USERNAME"},"label":"personality_insights","name":"pi-for-liberty","plan":"tiered","tags":["watson","ibm_created","ibm_dedicated_public"]}]}
  ```
  Copy the text above to *server.env* and update *url*, *username*, *password* with values from the credentials we generated in the previous step.

  *Note: to quickly convert the multiline string to a single line string, I used this [json viewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) and its "Remove white space" button.*
